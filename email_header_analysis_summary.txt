Email Header Analysis Summary
=============================

1. Originating IP:
   - X-Originating-IP: 185.123.45.67
   - Geolocation: Likely from Russia which is not associated with PayPal infrastructure.
   - Risk: The origin is very suspicious, which is often seen in phishing or fraudulent emails

2. Spoofed Domain:
   - From: "PayPal Support" <support@paypal-security-alerts.com>
   - Reply-To: support@paypal-security-alerts.com
   - Observation: Domain 'paypal-security-alerts.com' is NOT a legitimate PayPal domain.
   - Risk: Spoofing a trusted brand to deceive users and gain credentials.

3. Missing Authentication (SPF/DKIM):
   - No headers indicating SPF (Sender Policy Framework) validation
   - No DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signature found
   - Risk: Email authentication not enforced, making spoofing easier and harder to detect

Conclusion:
-----------
The email is highly suspicious and likely a phishing attempt. It includes a spoofed PayPal domain,
a suspicious IP origin, and lacks basic email authentication mechanisms.
